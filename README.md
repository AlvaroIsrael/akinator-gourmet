## 🗃 What is it?

This is just a console game to show node.js skills. It was part of a code challenge given to me by Objective enterprise.
The main pourpose of this code challenge was to reverse engenier a little game made with Java and replicate the behavior
to node.js. It suppose to behave similar to [akinator](https://pt.akinator.com/) and ask questions about food dishes.

📌 For transparency pourposes akinator is a very popular game across internet and there are many avaliable code examples
on github similar to this one. I made a research there before starting the project and made use of some code to develop
my own.

This project uses NodeJs with Typescript, so in order for it to work, frist navigate inside the project's folder and run
npm install to download the proper dependencies. I personally prefer to use yarn as a package manager, but all commands
will work with either yarn or npm. In case you choose npm, just go for 'npm run ' + command instead of 'yarn' + command.

```bash
cd akinator-gourmet
yarn install
```

After that we can start the game by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

## 🛠 How to test?

This project uses JestJs as a test library. To run unity tests execute the following commands inside the project folder:

```bash
