## 🗃 What is it?

This is just a console game to show node.js skills. It was part of a code challenge given to me by Objective enterprise.
The main pourpose of this code challenge was to reverse engenier a little game made with Java and replicate the behavior to node.js.
It suppose to behave similar to [akinator](https://pt.akinator.com/) and ask questions about food dishes.

📌 For transparency pourposes akinator is a very popular game across internet and there are many avaliable code examples on github similar to this one.
I made a research there before starting the project and made use of some code to develop my own.

## 💻 How to run?

This project uses NodeJs with Typescript, so in order for it to work, frist navigate inside the project's folder and run npm install to download the proper dependencies.
I personally prefer to use yarn as a package manager, but all commands will work with either yarn or npm.
```
cd akinator-gourmet
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After that we can run the game by running the following command:
```
npm build
npm start
or
yarn build
yarn start
```
